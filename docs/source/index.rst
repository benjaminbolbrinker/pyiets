pyIETS - a tool for calculating inelastic tunneling spectra
===========================================================
This program calculates inelastic tunneling spectra of molecules between molecular junctions using the ansatz from Troisi :cite:`troisi2008inelastic`. It reads vibrational modes from the output of the program SNF :cite:`neugebauer2002quantum` which is part of the MoViPac package :cite:`weymuth2012movipac`. For each mode two static singlepoint calculations are performed - one for each distorted molecule - using Turbomole :cite:`turbomole2010development`. Greensmatrices are calculated using the code ARTAIOS :cite:`deffner2009artaios` for each distorted molecule.
